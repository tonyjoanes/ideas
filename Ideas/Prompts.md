Prompt used for Micro SAAS idea generation:

> I'm looking for fresh micro SaaS product ideas that can be developed by one or two people. The focus is on creating solutions that save time or money, or improve upon existing but poorly executed ideas. I'm also interested in modernizing industries that still rely on outdated software. The product should be niche-focused, catering to specific industries or user groups. Please provide me with a list of ten innovative micro SaaS ideas
